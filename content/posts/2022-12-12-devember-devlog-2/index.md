Introduction:

Hello and welcome to my Devember devlog for the week of December 12th. This week, I continued work on my project, a custom controller for a Raspberry Pi-powered power distribution unit (PDU). I made some good progress this week, despite having to take a day off to study for an exam. In this devlog, I'll be sharing what I worked on this week and the progress I made.

Monday:

I had a busy day today, as I took the day off to prepare for and take my CKA exam. I didn't get around to working on my Devember project, but I'm feeling pretty good about the exam. I spent the day studying and reviewing the material, and I'm feeling confident that I did well on the exam. I'm looking forward to getting back to work on my Devember project tomorrow and continuing my progress.

Tuesday:

Today, I spent most of the day working on modding the gutted out psu for my controller. I started by adding DC jacks to it, which will allow me to power the controller with a standard power supply rather than having to rely on a custom solution. This was a bit of a challenge, as I had to carefully measure and drill holes in the psu case to fit the jacks. However, I was eventually able to get everything installed and working properly.

Next, I moved on to the controller frontplate. I removed all of the old buttons and mounted the new ones in their place. I then soldered individual wires to the buttons and LEDs, which will make them easier to connect to the rest of the circuit. This was a bit time-consuming, but I'm happy with how it turned out.

Wednesday:

Today, I spent most of the day working on the controller circuit. I started by soldering components to a protoboard in an attempt to make a custom PCB. This was a bit frustrating, as I was having some difficulty getting everything to work correctly. I had to troubleshoot and make a few changes to the circuit, but eventually I was able to get everything working properly.

However, I was not happy with the way the circuit was laid out on the protoboard, so I decided to switch to a custom PCB instead. I spent some time designing the PCB in KiCAD, and I'm much happier with the layout and organization of the components on the PCB. I'm looking forward to getting the PCB fabricated and assembled so that I can continue testing and debugging the controller.

Thursday:

Today, I spent most of the day working on the custom PCB for the controller. I continued working on the design in KiCAD, and I made a lot of progress. I added the remaining components to the PCB and routed the connections between them. I also added some labels and other details to the PCB to make it easier to understand and use.

However, I ran into some difficulty when trying to get the LCD display to work properly. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting and trying to figure out why it wasn't working, but I was ultimately unable to get it working. I'm a bit frustrated with the progress I'm making on the PCB, but I'm determined to figure it out and continue working on it.

Friday:

Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to work on Devember today. I had to spend the day studying for the CKAD exam I have on Monday, as I was a bit behind. I spent the day reviewing the material and practicing with sample questions, and I'm feeling pretty confident about the exam. I'm looking forward to getting back to work on my Devember project tomorrow and continuing my progress.

Saturday:

Today, I made some good progress on the controller. I started by setting up the circuit on a breadboard with the gutted out psu and a pi 4 for development. This will allow me to test and debug the controller as I continue to work on it. I was able to get everything set up and working properly, and I'm happy with the progress I made.

Ending:

That's it for this week's devlog. I'm happy with the progress I made on my Devember project, despite having to take a day off to study for an exam. I'm looking forward to continuing my work on the project next week and hopefully making even more progress. Thank you for reading, and I'll be back with another update next week.
