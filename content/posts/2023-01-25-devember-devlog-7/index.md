- dirtiest wiring job of my life lol

### Saturday

- went to a local hardware store to get some more components
- wrote the devlog for the previous week as I was WAY behind ðŸ˜…
- did the cable management for the components inside the case and wired everything up properly, cleaned everything up nicely. looks kinda pro now, ngl

### Sunday

- redesigned the internal layout of the components inside the server case
- cut holes into the pipdu server PCB to mount it to the case
- cut a plastic board to fit between the server pcb and the relay board in order to stagger the screws pattern and drilled the required holes
- cut a few pieces of plastic to make a mount for the arduino on top of the relay board

## Conclusion

- finally starting to get back on track, sadly it is kinda late and I am afraid i will not finish on time
- excited as things are in the last stretch and are getting put together
