Hello, there! Normally, I'd be writing this devlog to provide updates on the progress I made in the previous week on this Devember project. This time, however, I found myself scartching my head as to why I am writing this when I didn't really have the time to really work on anything...

That being said, for this week I will drop the daily log and just go over the things that got done this week, as we'll get it done much quicker that way.

## Sixth Week Review

Let's start off with a bit of context. Last week, my dad and I finsihed off by drilling all the holes in the new front panel of the server case and decided that we need to mod it even further. Having the power sockets on the detachable panel was not a great ideea in terms of reliability. We had to cut the case at every edge, getting individual panels, basically, in order to redesign the way it closes. While we did manage to make the cuts using a hand operated guillotine, we did not get around to modding it any further.

Now, for this week we needed to finish the server case. Basically, we needed to think of a way to make the top panel detachable instead of the front one and then re-build the case, mount all the power sockets, do the wiring for them and, hopefully, mount the components inside.

Since the end of the month is not that far away, I started to get worried that I might not finis the project in time. As such, I dusted up my manager hat and started delegating. Dad is more of a handyman than I am, and he actually does know how to use all of the tools he has in his garage. As such I thought it was an acceptable ideea that he proceeds to work on the server case to drill all the remaining holes according to the plans we made together and then start doing the wiring for the sockets themselves.

While he did that, I worked on passing this uni semester as it is coming to a close and all of the projects I ignored for the past weeks are now due. Also, finals season is upon us ðŸ’€... Anyway, while I did not get to do much work on PiPDU myself, I did manage to add some new features to my website and post another blog post, so at least there's that... I guess... I may not have the best prioritization skills, but at least I did get **some** work done

So what actually did we (dad) get done this week? Well, we decided on a design for the case and how to put it back together and then we (dad) actually cut all the alluminium angle brackets and drilled all the holes to assemble the case.

Next, we (dad) did quite a bit of the wiring for the power sockets, as we already decided where the relay board would be located inside the case.

And that's really about it. We also soldered up the connections on both the controller and server PCBs, but I forgot to take pictures of those and there wasn't really much to showcase anyway.

## Conclusion

Thanks for tuning in to another week of these devlogs. This one has been pretty tame and I did not manage to do much. Hopefully, I manage to get back on track ASAP as I am running out of time and I am quite behind on the backlog... I hope I'll get to finish this project in time!

See you in the next one! ðŸ‘‹
