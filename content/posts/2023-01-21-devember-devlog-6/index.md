Hello, there! Normally, I'd be writing this devlog to provide updates on the progress I made in the previous week on this Devember project, but for this week I found myself scartching my head as to why I am writing this when I didn't really have the time to work on anything.

## Sixth Week Review

So for this week I was, yet again, really busy with university work. In hindsight, I really should have expected that, being the end of the semester and having all my final exams in the next couple weeks... Anyway, let's just chalk it up to happenstance and agree that there was nothing within my powers I could've done to foresee nor prevent this ðŸ˜“.

I dusted up my manager hat and, in the panic of running out of time, started delegating. Since dad is more of a handyman than I am, and he actually does know how to use all of the tools he has in his garage, I thought it was an acceptable ideea that he proceeds to work on the server case to drill all the remaining holes according to the plans we made together and then start doing the wiring for the sockets themselves.

Now... that sounds great and wouldn't have made me feel bad had I had any time to actually work on something myself as well. You might see where this is going... I did not have time to work on much, partly due to uni work and also partly because I just had my poor prioritization work together with my procrastination and I just worked on my website and blog in general. I added some new features and published another blog post, but that's unrelated to this project. So in the grand scheme of things, I didn't really do anything this week. Okay, maybe not actually NOTHING, I did solder up the PCB for the server (together with dad), but that's about it... so yeah... Progress? I guess

Yeah, I don't know how to wrap up this one... I personally made little to no progress on the project (dad did great, btw), but I hope I will manage to catch up and finish in time, especially since my finals are also closing in.
