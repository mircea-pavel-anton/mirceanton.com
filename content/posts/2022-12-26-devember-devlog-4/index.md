## Fourth Week Review

### Monday

- had my CKS exam, did not work on piPDU

### Tuesday

- fixed all errors in the PCB and Schematic designs
- added mounting holes and tweaked the traces a bit

### Wednesday

- I initially sat down to work on the project and realized I am not too sure what to work on. I thought I should take some time to plan out what is left to do, at least as general ideas to focus my work better. Some extra features I decided to work on next:

    - implement the ability to trigger custom actions before actually powering off the socket. For example, sending some commands to gracefully shut down the system before powering it off
    - implement the ability to name sockets to know what is connected where
    - implement dedicated endpoints for turning sockets on/off instead of just a toggle endpoint
    - implement a full `info` endpoint to get status and other details for the sockets
    - create a `yaml` config file to store the custom names and commands for the sockets

### Thursday

- realized I neglect my masters degree assignments for the past few weeks so I had to do all the assignments as most of them were due this week :')

### Friday

### Saturday

### Sunday
